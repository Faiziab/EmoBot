# EmoBot: Real-Time Emotion Detection With Voice-Activated Assistant


Welcome to the EmoBot project! ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ¤

EmoBot is an innovative project that combines real-time emotion detection with a voice-activated assistant, creating an interactive and emotionally-aware AI companion. This repository contains all the code and resources you need to build your own EmoBot and explore the exciting world of emotion-aware artificial intelligence.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection using computer vision techniques.
- Voice-activated assistant powered by state-of-the-art speech recognition.
- Emotion-specific responses and interactions tailored to the user's emotional state.
- Seamless integration with various hardware setups, including cameras and microphones.

## Getting Started
